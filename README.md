## Account
`AccountProtocol` defines basic properties for account, such as `kind` (active/passive/both), `group` (balance sheet/income statement; asset/liability, etc - as defined in `AccountGroup` enum) and account `balance`.

### The `Account` type

The `Account` type describes **generic** account for tracking monetary value, conforms to `AccountProtocol`.

```swift
struct Account<AccountType: AccountTypeProtocol>
```

`AccountTypeProtocol` demands static properties for kind and group.
A bunch of types, conforming to AccountTypeProtocol, are defined as case-less enums with static properties `kind` and `group`, for example `AccountsReceivable`, `Cash`, `COGS`, `Revenue`, etc.

### The `Inventory Account` type

## Order

Types conforming to `OrderProtocol`:

* Inventory Order
* Production Order
* Purchase Order
* Sales Order

## Client

## Supplier

## Fixed Asset

## Product

* Raw Material
* Work in Progress
* Finished Good

## Books

* Business Operations: Book Revenue, Depreciate Fixed Asset, Purchase Raw Material, Receive Cash, Record Finished Goods


## Techniques used

### - Phantom types and type-safe identifiers

Phantom types are used in `struct Account<AccountType>` and type safe identifiers `TBD` to provide type safety.
